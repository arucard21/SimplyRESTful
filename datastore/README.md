Examples on how to use the SimplyRESTful library

This is an example of the SimplyRESTful library used with jetty, where:
* `datastore/` contains code needed to represent an existing data store containing data that will be exposed through the API. You likely already have some kind of data store available, so this is only needed to make this example work.
* `resources/` contains the actual example code. It has an API resource and an API endpoint with the required methods implemented for use with this example's data store.

You can easily run this example by executing the main class in ExampleAPIServer.java.
