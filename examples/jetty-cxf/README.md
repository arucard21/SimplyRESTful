Example on how to create a SimplyRESTful API using the `deploy-jetty-cxf` library.

In this example, the API is created with Apache CXF on Jetty. The resources are stored directly through a DAO (Data Access Object) in a Java List object in memory. 

You can run this example by executing the main class in `ExampleCXFJettyServer.java`.
