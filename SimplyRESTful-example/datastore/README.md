Examples on how to use the SimplyRESTful library

This is the datastore used by all the examples of the SimplyRESTful library. It contains code needed to represent an existing data store containing data that will be exposed through the API. Anyone implementing an API will likely already have some kind of data store available, so this is only needed to make the examples work.
